///
/// <para>That matters because of what the app is. A duty handset spends
/// its life in someone's pocket; the interesting failures happen while
/// nobody is looking at it, and the process is quite likely to be killed
/// by the OS before it is ever looked at again. Without this, an error at
/// 3am waits for whenever the responder next opens the app. With it, the
/// error is on its way within the moment it happened, which is the
/// difference between diagnosing a missed alert and guessing at one.</para>

/// <para>Deliberately does nothing below <see cref="LogEventLevel.Error"/>.
/// Routine events can wait for the timer; forcing a pipeline rebuild for
/// every informational line would cost far more than it bought.</para>
